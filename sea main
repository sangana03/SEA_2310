# **IMC503 – Data Science Toolkit SEA Lab Assessment**

### **Q2: Excel-Based Marks Generation & Grading**

This repository contains the Excel sheet created as part of the SEA Lab Assessment for IMC503. All calculations and data processing in the Excel file are performed **strictly using Excel formulas**, with no hard-coded values, as instructed.

---

## **📘 What the Excel Sheet Contains**

### **1. Student Marks Data**

The Excel sheet includes:

* ISA marks for IMC 503 (taken from Google Classroom)
* Automatically extrapolated SEA marks based on ISA
* Marks for other subjects appearing in the hall ticket (generated using formulas)

All data entries are linked through formulas so that if ISA marks change, all final results update automatically.

---

## **📈 2. SEA Marks Extrapolation**

The SEA (final exam) marks are extrapolated based on ISA performance using a proportional scaling formula such as:

```
= (ISA_Marks / ISA_Max) * SEA_Max
```

This ensures fairness and consistency in the projected SEA score.

---

## **📊 3. Total Marks & Percentage Calculation**

The sheet calculates:

* **Total marks** for each subject
* **Percentage scored**
* **Final overall percentage** (if applicable)

These computations are entirely formula-driven, ensuring full automation.

Example formula:

```
= (Total_Obtained / Total_Max) * 100
```

---

## **🎓 4. Grade Assignment**

Grades are assigned automatically using **nested IF formulas** based on the provided grading scheme.

Example:

```
=IF(PERC>=85,"O",
 IF(PERC>=75,"A+",
 IF(PERC>=65,"A",
 IF(PERC>=55,"B+",
 IF(PERC>=50,"B",
 IF(PERC>=45,"C",
 IF(PERC>=40,"P","F")))))))
```

A matching **Grade Points** column is also generated using similar formulas.

---

## **🧮 5. Formula-Driven Data Generation**

No values are manually typed except the initial ISA marks.
Everything else — SEA marks, generated subject marks, percentages, grades, grade points — is fully automated.

This ensures transparency, reproducibility, and correctness of the evaluation model.
